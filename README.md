# Roaming

One click to get a random rem. Gamification experience. Roam freely in your rems.

## Features

- Click "Roam" button to get a random rem.
- Click "Block" button means current rem do not want to encounter again.
- Automatically block some of remnote's built-in rem, so the block number will automatically increase.
- Gamification, roam to get experience value, and then level up!
- Custom config level and title.
- Rich data records, know your rems total, how many more experience to level up, and so on.
- Support Darkmode

## Note

If you have too many rems, when you first click Roam, that will be slow, But after that, everything will be fast, 
because I cache all the rems ids, and if you have new rems you want to add to the roaming pool, 
you can update the cache by clicking the button in the upper right corner
